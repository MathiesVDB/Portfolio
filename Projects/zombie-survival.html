    <h1>AI Agent</h1>
    <p>
        This was a project I did for the Gameplay Programming course at Howest DAE. Together with the research project. <br>
        The goal was to write an AI agent that could make simple decisions in a zombie survival game in order to survive. <br>
        <br>
        The agent made decisions based on a behaviour tree. <br>

        The agent was also able to walk around the world along a grid to make sure he did not walk through the same
        area multiple times. <br>

        The agent also managed its own inventory, by finding items in the world and picking them up. <br>
        Then my memory class would remember the items and which inventory slot they were in. <br>
        All that was left after that was to let the behaviour tree decide which item to use at which time. <br>
