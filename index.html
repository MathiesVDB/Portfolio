    <h1>Mathies Van den Bulcke, Game Developer</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
    I'm Mathies Van den Bulcke, a game developer from Belgium. <br>
    I am currently a student at DAE Howest Kortrijk. <br> 
    On this website I have listed some of the projects I have worked on in the last couple of years. <br> 
    I mainly program in C++, however I am also able to work in C#, Python, LUA and even a bit of 6502 assembly. <br>
    I also have experience in Unity and a bit in Unreal Engine.
    </p>

                This project is a Dig Dug remake made in C++. The goal of this project was to 
                create our own game engine, starting from the bare minimum. And then create 
                a given game with it to show its capabilities. For more information, you can take a look at the Github repository.

                Project made for Unwrap Jam 2025 together with 2 other programmers. We made the game in Unity.
                We ended up finishing 2nd place in the jam. During this project I learned a lot of new things about
                Unity and how to work with a team of programmers. Find out more about the game on our Itch.io page.

                    This was a group project created for an elective during my first semester of second year at Howest DAE.
                    It thought us 6502 assembly, which was not only a lot of fun, but also helped me understand how CPU's work better.
                    We decided to create the google dinosaur game in assembly, which ended up looking great.

                        For the Game Projects course at Howest DAE, we were divided into groups to create a game.
                        My group decided to create a 2D platformer with a unique mechanic: the 2 players are connected by a curse.
                        This means the players need to time their movements and actions to progress through the level and collecting all breadcrumbs.
                        The game is called Jointed, and it was created using the Unity engine.
                        I was one of 3 programmers in our group.

                        For the graphics programming course at Howest DAE we had to create a dual rasterizer for our exam project.
                        We had to create a program that can switch between a software rasterizer and a hardware rasterizer.

                        This project helped me understand the strenght of GPU's and how they work.
                        It also taught me how 3D rendering works behind the scenes, which was very interesting.

                        For one of my courses at Howest DAE, I had to create a game using the Lua programming language.
                        For this I did a remake of the google dinosaur game.
                        The game has a simple C++ game engine behind the scenes, which I can communicate with using Lua scripts.
